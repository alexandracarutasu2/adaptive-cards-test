## adaptive-cards-test
This is the test application built in the weeks 2 and 3 of Microsoft Dublin 2023 internship.

# How to run?
Clone the repository on your computer. <br>
Open the project using your preferred IDE (I personally used Visual Studio Code). <br>
Open a new terminal and run command <code>npm start</code>. <br>
This will run the project locally on port 8080, so to access it open your preferred browser and go to "http://localhost:8080/". <br>

<br>
Congrats! Now you should be able too see the beautifully rendered and styled Adaptive Cards.

# How it works?
